[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/soft-matter/trackpy-examples)

This is a trove of **sample data, tutorials, examples, and speed tests** for the
[trackpy particle-tracking toolkit](https://github.com/soft-matter/trackpy).
See trackpy proper for installation instructions and more information about
the project, including full documentation. Here, you can [browse the example Jupyter
notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/soft-matter/trackpy-examples/tree/master/notebooks/),
[try out the notebooks *live*](http://mybinder.org/repo/soft-matter/trackpy-examples) 
with the [Binder](http://mybinder.org/) service, or, once you've installed `trackpy`, 
download the entire repository and explore.

This repository is kept separate from the `trackpy` code because image and
video data are large. Its goal is to collect instructive notebooks and data
sets that represent the many ways in which people use `trackpy`.
If you have a notebook that teaches a way to use `trackpy`, please submit
a pull request or get in touch with us!
