v0.4.2
------

This is a minor release with two major new features: parallel processing to
speed up feature-finding, and a new method for locating features in
bright-field microscopy. There is also an overhaul of the walkthrough and other
tutorials, and compatibility with the latest version of Pandas (0.25.1).


API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- "trackpy.locate" and associated functions now report "ep" to be NaN when
  there is only one usable background pixel to sample. (:issue:`519`)

- "trackpy.legacy.linking.link_df" does not copy a DataFrame automatically
  anymore if the provided DataFrame is a view. (:issue:`503`)

- The "locate" options in "trackpy.batch" are now collected in "**kwargs"
  (except for "diameter") and passed to the wrapped "trackpy.locate" function.
  This means when using the "meta" option of "trackpy.batch" only explicitly
  given options for the wrapped "trackpy.locate" are saved to the file;
  unspecified options using default values from "locate" aren't saved.
  (:issue:`499`)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for multiprocessing to "trackpy.batch". (:issue:`499`)

- "trackpy.locate_brightfield_ring" enables precise tracking of large
  particles in bright-field microscopy. There is a new tutorial to demonstrate
  it. (:issue:`527`)

- Added "trackpy.linking.link_partial" to allow linking a movie in separate 
  pieces. (:issue:`445`)

- Many updates and improvements to the tutorials. Most notably, the walkthrough
  is revised and updated for the latest versions of trackpy and pims, and code
  from all tutorials should now run in recent Python environments.
  (:issue:`567`, :issue:`524`, :issue:`539`, :issue:`543`, :issue:`541`,
  :issue:`532`, :issue:`157`, :issue:`558`, :issue:`505`, :issue:`525`). Most of
  these changes were made in the trackpy-examples repository on GitHub.

- Smaller improvements to other documentation for the linking and
  feature-finding APIs. (:issue:`545`, :issue:`551`, :issue:`550`, 
  :issue:`522`, :issue:`540`, :issue:`542`)

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed incompatibility with recent Pandas (:issue:`529`, :issue:`538`)
- Removed warnings in case Pandas 0.23 is used (:issue:`503`)
- Removed warnings in case Pandas 0.25 is used (:issue:`545`)

- "trackpy.diag.dependencies" now gives information about a more complete set
  of packages.

v0.4.1
------

This is a minor release with some important fixes. Additionally, PIMS is no
longer a required dependency, which makes installation easier.


API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- PIMS (Python IMage Sequence) is no longer a required dependency (:issue:`492`)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improved performance of adaptive search (:issue:`489`)
- Reduced memory usage during linking (:issue:`489`)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix enable_numba on Py3.6 and MS Windows systems (:issue:`486`)


v0.4.0
------

This is a major release that includes new choices for linking and feature-finding algorithms, as well as many
performance increases and clean-ups. It is recommended for all trackpy users, but may require
minor changes to existing code, as detailed below.

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- locate has a more modular structure that makes it easier to customize feature-finding (:issue:`400`, :issue:`406`)

- The default value of smoothing_size is smaller, and more consistent with
  other implementations of this algorithm. In general, particle
  mass values will be different. The new minmass_v04_change function helps
  update minmass values in existing code (:issue:`401`, :issue:`465`)

- The "minmass" parameter now has a default value of 0 (:issue:`400`)

- The "filter_before" option is no longer supported (:issue:`400`)

- Major refactor of the linking code giving linking a better API (:issue:`416`, :issue:`414`)

- Linking diagnostics are no longer supported (:issue:`414`)

- link_df always creates a copy of the data; it can no longer work in-place (:issue:`414`)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improved performance of feature finding (:issue:`361`)

- Improved performance of linking (:issue:`400`, :issue:`406`)

- New refinement method using least squares optimization (:issue:`407`)

- New linker that combines feature-finding with linking (FindLinker) (:issue:`407`, :issue:`410`, :issue:`411`, :issue:`416`, :issue:`428`)

- Linking in non-Euclidean coordinate systems and curved metrics (:issue:`448`)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix compute_drift if dataframes are not sorted (:issue:`409`)

- Fix double counting of non-linking penalty in non-numba linkers (:issue:`430`)

- Fix the N column for emsd (:issue:`434`)
