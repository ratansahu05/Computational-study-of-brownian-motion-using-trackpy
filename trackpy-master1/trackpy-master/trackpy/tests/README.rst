Testing
=======

This suite of tests verifies that everything is working as expected. There are unit tests, checking for sanity. There are systems tests, running multistep calculations to reproduce the result of a control experiment such as the viscosity of water. (So far, that's the only one.)

Tests should be run using unittest_.
